Parenchyma Segmentation
=======================

NOTE: UNDER DEVELOPMENT. Scripted python module for slicer that can segment the liver based on input from the user.

How it works
------------
* The user annotates a medical image using a drawing tool.
* The module then segments the object inside the annotation
